# Questions about Assigned Quiz Problems and Recipes


[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 1]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): What kind of data combining method is being used in this question?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): This problem shows a case of one-to-one matching. The number of data lines is equal
to the table with the smallest number of data lines.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 2]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): Same question as problem 1? What kind of data combining method am I seeing here?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): This is a case of concatenation.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 3]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): Since I see "set" in the program, will I see one-to-one matching?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): No, one-to-one matching requires more than one "set" statement, what we will see is
concatenation.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 4]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): Will the answer be b) since the three tables being concantenated have ID 2 in
common?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): The answer is actually a, and the value of sales is missing for observation 2. The
answer would be b) $30,000 if match-merging were used.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 5]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): I notice the tables have different entries for age for the same SSN. How are mismatches
handled in SAS?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): The value of age in the first table is overwritten by the value of age from susequent tables.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 6]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): What happens when two tables being merged with different columns counts?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): There's a conditional statement IF which excludes unmatched values. Without it then lines
of data will have missing data.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 7]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): Is the question asking if a variable has Blue and the lines of data do not match, to
print a new dataline with missing entries instead?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): No, overwriting is prevented by renaming the DATA in the MERGE statement. Going from blue
to navy.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 8]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): Will the resulting code overwrite values for some of the duplicate IDs?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): The code actually doesn't run at all since the two tables are not sorted by ID. Need
proc SORT first.



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 9]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): If none of the columns are sorted in either ascending or descending order, will there
be no processing of combining the tables?



[Chapter 10 Quiz, Problem 10]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): How can I tell when a value will be over written? Column names?



[combining-data-horizontally-with-data-step SAS Recipe]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): Why do I need to have, under the label keyword, have to have CDS_Code=" " for, instance?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): It looks like it is necessary to corrected column names.



[combining-data-horizontally-with-proc-sql SAS Recipe]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): What do the blocks 'select' and 'from' do in the code?



[combining-data-vertically-with-data-step SAS Recipe]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): What are the purpose of the 'do' and 'end' keywords and the logic behind them? I am
familiar with 'do' loops, so this usage of 'do' is new to me.



[combining-data-vertically-with-proc-sql SAS Recipe]
* Question (anguyen82-stat660): What is the purpose of the '*' after select?
* Answer (anguyen82-stat660): The asterix '*' is used as shorthand to include all the columns.
